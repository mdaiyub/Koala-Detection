# Koala-Detection
Custom YOLO Version DATA LINK: https://github.com/mdaiyub/Koala-Detection
To get the data set into the YOLO version, I first manually annotated each data bound box by Roboflow online annotator tools, 
then exported the annotated and non-annotated data simultaneously to the YOLO version.
