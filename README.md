Custom YOLO Version DATA LINK: [Koala-Detection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_aKb-jiZBP3Xi9fnzs8rtcBHEQsaG5Id?usp=sharing)
To get the data set into the YOLO version, I first manually annotated each data bound box by Roboflow online annotator tools, 
then exported the annotated and non-annotated data simultaneously to the YOLO version.
